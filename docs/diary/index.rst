Lots of decisions made along the way. People might be interested in the
why as well as the what. Below is a reverse-chronogological order listing
of summaries with links to longer pages.

Write Initial Tests
===================

I did a bunch of this in February 2019 before dropping goku, picked back
up in June 2019. The idea: before doing any more re-implementation, write
a bunch of pytest tests using sphinx fixtures. :doc:`More... <write_initial_tests>`

Research API
============

Some notes I made during a crazy research session. Should all be obsoleted
later on. :doc:`More... <research_api>`

Copy Alabaster
==============

I've done this before, where I start with a clean slate. I never get all
the contract fulfilled. Not even close. This time I'll start with an Alabaster
theme, write some tests, and gradually document/re-implement. :doc:`More... <copy_alabaster>`

Preparation
===========

I needed a basic Python package repo layout with some "stuff". :doc:`More... <preparation>`
