Things I Hate
=============

Want to let your IDE navigate you to a macro?
Better hope it's in a directory magically marked as a template directory.

``css_t`` means no help from my editor...not just syntax highlighting and autocomplete, but navigation, refactoring, etc.

Sure wish I could run coverage on my templates to see test coverage. Or black. Or mypy.

The ``toctree`` directive is pretty cool.
But the HTML it generates is pretty far beyond my control as a customizer.
